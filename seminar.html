         <h2>How IOT Works</h2>
         <p>
            Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that involves connecting everyday physical devices to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. Here's a brief breakdown of how it works:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sensors and Devices: Physical devices, like sensors or actuators, are embedded with technology to collect and exchange data. These devices can range from simple temperature sensors to complex machinery.</li>
                <li>Connectivity: The collected data is transmitted over the internet or other communication networks. This can be done through various means, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, or even satellite communication.</li>
                    <li>Data Processing: The data collected from these devices often needs to be processed to extract meaningful information. This processing can occur locally on the device itself or be transmitted to a central server or cloud for analysis.</li>
                        <li>Cloud Computing: In many IoT applications, data is sent to cloud servers for storage, analysis, and further processing. Cloud platforms provide the necessary infrastructure for handling large volumes of data and running complex algorithms.</li>
                            <li>User Interface: Users can interact with IoT devices and systems through applications or interfaces. This could be a web or mobile app that allows users to monitor and control connected devices remotely.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Architecture Layers of IOT</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device Layer (Perception Layer):
                    The device layer is where physical devices, sensors, and actuators reside.
                    Devices in this layer collect data from the physical world. Examples include temperature sensors, cameras, and actuators that control physical processes.
                    This layer is responsible for sensing and capturing real-world information.</li>
                <li>CConnection Layer (Network Layer):
                    The connection layer facilitates communication between devices and the transfer of data.
                    It includes communication protocols and technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, and more.
                    This layer ensures that devices can reliably send and receive data, forming the backbone of IoT connectivity./li>
                    <li>Platform Layer (Middleware Layer):
                        The platform layer acts as an intermediary between the device layer and the application layer.
                        It includes components like message brokers, data storage, and communication protocols.
                        This layer manages the flow of data, addressing issues like data formatting, security, and scalability. It's crucial for handling the complexities of large-scale IoT systems.</li>
                        <li>Application Layer:
                            The application layer is where data is processed, analyzed, and transformed into meaningful insights.
                            It includes applications, analytics engines, and decision-making systems.
                            Users interact with the IoT system through interfaces in this layer, and actions or alerts are generated based on the analyzed data.</li>
