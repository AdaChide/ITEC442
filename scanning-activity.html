        <p>Our goal with this activity is to perform a scan here i chose MacOS terminal which is also similar to the linux (Using same Unix environment)which will give us a more detailed look at what we are looking for, this includes what we are looking for including hops, Biggest Delays, Main Server, Registered Contacts , MX Record and website host. </p>
        <h2>Hops</h2>
        <img src="traceroute.png" alt="Traceroute output">
        <div class="task-description">
            <p>
                In Task 1, we used the traceroute command to trace the route from our machine to the assigned website, which is chideraadaeze.github.io in this case.
                Traceroute provides information about the number of hops or network nodes between our machine and the destination website, helping us understand the path that data packets take to reach the destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The output of the traceroute command shows that there are multiple network nodes (hops) between our machine and the website. It lists the IP addresses of these nodes, along with the round-trip time (in milliseconds) it takes for packets to travel to each node.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notably, some hops did not respond (denoted by '*'), which can happen due to firewall or security configurations that prevent response to traceroute requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, traceroute provides valuable insights into the network path to the website, helping us identify the number of hops, response times, and potential bottlenecks in the route.

        <h2>Biggest Delays and Average Duration</h2>
        <img src="Delay.jpg" alt="cropped image for the biggest delay">
        <div class="task-description">
            <p>
                At "hop 6," the response time is significantly higher compared to the previous hops. The RTT for this hop is approximately 925.771 milliseconds, which is notably longer than the response times at other hops.
<br>
                The average duration of this delay can be considered to be around 925.771 milliseconds for "hop 6." It's worth noting that such delays can occur for various reasons, including network congestion, router configuration, or other factors in the network path.

            <p>There are four authoritative name servers (NS records) for "google.com":

                <br>
                These name servers are responsible for handling DNS queries for the "google.com" domain. The entire query took 54 milliseconds, and it was answered by the DNS server at 192.168.25.1.</p>
