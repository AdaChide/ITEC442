        <h1>What is a 'Fully Digital Enterprise'?</h1>
        <p>An organization that completely integrates digital tools and technology into all aspects of its operations in order to increase productivity, create a better customer experience, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes.</p>

        <h2>An example of a fully digital enterprise:</h2>
        <p>One example is Spotify. Spotify is an online music streaming service that uses data and algorithms to create personalized playlists and recommendations for each user based on their moods, habits, and preferences. It also leverages cloud computing to stream songs to users across different devices and platforms. Spotify innovates with new features and formats, such as social listening, video podcasts, and live audio. It is based on data and analytics to optimize its content licensing and creation based on the demand and feedback from its global audience. It has expanded into new markets and segments, such as gaming and education. Spotify has leveraged technology to create a customer-centric, innovative, and agile business model.</p>

        <h1>What are the Cyber Security Challenges?</h1>
        <p>These are problems that arise from the protection of information systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>Cyber Security Challenges/Concerns with a fully digital enterprise:</h2>
        <p>1. Ransomware Extortion: Attackers may encrypt data, denying legitimate users access, and demand a ransom for recovery.</p>
        <p>2. Lack of Skilled Cybersecurity Professionals: High demand for expertise in cybersecurity, both technically and at the business level.</p>
        <p>3. Mobile Malware: Malicious applications masquerading as legitimate ones, such as QR code readers and games.</p>
        <p>4. Cloud Third-Party Threats: Increasing adoption of cloud computing raises security implications, including the shared security model.</p>
        <p>5. Wipers and Destructive Malware: These malware types delete data entirely instead of breaching information.</p>

        <h1>Cyber Security Challenges for a Bricks and Mortar SME Wanting to Become a Digital Enterprise:</h1>
        <p>1. Lack of Expertise: SMEs may not have sufficient knowledge to implement and maintain robust cybersecurity solutions.</p>
        <p>2. Legacy Systems: Existing infrastructure may lack strong security measures, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p>
        <p>3. Business Continuity: Transitioning to a digital enterprise involves potential disruptions, and SMEs need to ensure they can maintain operations during the transition.</p>
        <p>4. Limited Budget: SMEs often face budget constraints, making it challenging to invest in adequate cybersecurity solutions.</p>
        <p>5. Employee Awareness and Training: SMEs may need to educate and train employees on cybersecurity best practices to mitigate risks.</p>

        <h2>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?</h2>
        <p>The energy crisis in 2022 led to an increased dependence on digital technologies as remote work and online services became more necessary. The increased reliance on digital infrastructure could potentially exacerbate the existing cybersecurity challenges faced by fully digital enterprises.</p>
