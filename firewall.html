        <h2>Firewall Basics</h2>
        <p>
            A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to a private network by filtering incoming information from the internet. It acts as a barrier, blocking unwanted traffic and permitting only desired traffic.

        <h2>Purpose of a Firewall</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a safety barrier between a private and the public internet to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Allows active monitoring and management of network access.</li>
            <li>Protects against spyware, hackers, and other cyber threats.</li>
            <li>Preserves the privacy of devices or networks.</li>
            <li>Enables the establishment and implementation of security policies and rules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Firewalls</h2>
        <p>Firewalls can have different structures, functionality, and traffic-filtering methods. Here are some common types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Packet Filtering Firewalls:</strong> Operate at junction points like routers and switches, checking data packets against established criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy-Level or Application-Level Firewalls:</strong> Operate at the application level, using pre-configured policies to manage messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewalls:</strong> Evaluate data packets based on a database of previous successful connections, offering greater security but potentially impacting network performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):</strong> Combine various methods, monitoring packets at an application level and conducting quick network assessments to detect suspicious or invasive activity.</li>
        </ul>
