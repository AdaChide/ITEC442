            <h2>Setting Up a Honeypot on Kali Linux</h2>
            <p>A honeypot is basically a cybersecurity mechanism set up to detect, deflect, or study attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. It's like a trap for cyber attackers. The honeypot looks like a vulnerable system or network, enticing hackers to interact with it. This way, security professionals can observe their tactics, techniques, and procedures to enhance overall system security.</p>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Started with opening the terminal</li>
                <li>Used <code>ifconfig</code> to list my network and get the IP address</li>
                <li>Used the <code>cd</code> command to change directory into the pentbox 1.8</li>
                <li>In order to run the program, used <code>./pentbox.rb</code> to set up the honeypot by following the instructions displayed by the program</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Explanation of commands used:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>IFCONFIG: This command displays the network settings eg ipaddress</li>
                    <li>CD: Is a command used to change on debian operating system such as kali linux
                        Then i entered command ls to list out the whole directory</li>
                    <li>You can use <code>./&lt;filename&gt;</code> to run a file</li>
                </ol>
                Honeypot is a trap that helps in catching attrackers 
Port 443 is used explicitly for HTTPS services and hence is the standard port for HTTPS (encrypted) traffic
secure connection failed means it could not transfer data
